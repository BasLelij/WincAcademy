        Boxing (also known as &quot;Western boxing&quot; or
        &quot;pugilism&quot;) is a combat sport in which two people, usually
        wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand
        wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined
        amount of time in a boxing ring.

        Although the term &quot;boxing&quot; is commonly attributed to
        &quot;western boxing&quot;, in which only the fists are involved, boxing
        has developed in various ways in different geographical areas and
        cultures. In global terms, boxing is a set of combat sports focused on
        striking, in which two opponents face each other in a fight using at
        least their fists, and possibly involving other actions such as kicks,
        elbow strikes, knee strikes, and headbutts, depending on the rules. Some
        of the forms of the modern sport are western boxing, bare knuckle
        boxing, kickboxing, muay-thai, lethwei, savate, and sanda.[1][2] Boxing
        techniques have been incorporated into many martial arts, military
        systems, and other combat sports.

        While humans have fought in hand-to-hand combat since the dawn of human
        history, the earliest evidence of any type of boxing can be seen in
        Sumerian carvings from the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC.[3][4][5][6] The
        earliest evidence of boxing rules date back to Ancient Greece, where
        boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC.[3] Boxing evolved
        from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to
        the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867
        introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules.

        Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a
        standard fixture in most international games &mdash; it also has its own
        world championships. Boxing is overseen by a referee over a series of
        one-to-three-minute intervals called &quot;rounds&quot;.

        A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a
        referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualifies of an
        opponent, or the resignation of an opponent. When the fight reaches the
        end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the judges'
        scorecards determine the victor. In case both fighters gain equal scores
        from the judges, a professional bout is considered a draw. In Olympic
        boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to
        one fighter on technical criteria.
